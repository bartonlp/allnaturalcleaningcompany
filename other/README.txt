# These are the backups of the 'allnatural' database. See the MySitemap.php file. NOTE MySitemap.php and the other/ and scripts/
# directories are not rsync'ed from 'allnaturaltest'! The ~/bin/update-allnatural.sh file uses --exclude's to prevent the
# copying of the MySitemap.php and other/ and scripts/ directories from being copied or deleted!
# We do not backup the 'allnaturaltest' database. And we do not backup the Sitemap.xml file.
