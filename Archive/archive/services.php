About us:
All natural cleaning is the first janitorial cleaning company in the state of New Mexico and possibly in the country to use nothing but 100 percent natural cleaning products like white vinegar, baking soda, lemon, corn starch, hydrogen peroxide, flour, Isopropyl Alcohol, Lavender oil and many other naturally occurring products.

We do not use green products simply because 98 percent of them are not telling the truth about their ingredients also the law does not require them to tell the truth. These products are being produced by the same companies that were producing the old toxic products  or by their subsidiaries to make it look like a new Green company .So the consumer wont relate the two together even though its one company.
We have researched a lot of the so called Green products we found them to be more expensive and many of their products are harmful either short term or long term. We did not want to take a chance on our clients health. 
Your health and your familys health cannot be trusted to corporate America. When it comes to making billions of dollars of profit versus keeping you healthy who do you think will win?

 Ill let you answer that question.

 We have decided to err on the safe side and use nothing but natural stuff the majority of our products are 100 percent edible. We are a small business thats locally owned and operated ready to make a huge difference in peoples lives.
After we clean your home or office you will feel a lot better and we will show you how to get rid of all the toxins around  the house or office that are killing you slowly. 

If you care about your health the health of your loved ones or those you work with. Call us now or email us for an estimate.
