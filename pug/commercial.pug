    p The  
      b All Natural Cleaning Company 
      | uses only natural toxin free ingredients. 
      | An important question commercial customers never ask of their cleaning companies; what kind 
      | of chemicals are you using to clean my place? The American worker spends on average 8.8 hrs. 
      | daily in the office. Depending on what kind of harmful chemicals the cleaning company is using 
      | whether daily or weekly the unsuspecting workers are being exposed to these toxic chemicals 
      | from the moment they walk in until they leave, for 8 straight hours. The short term health effects 
      | of these chemicals can range from headaches, allergy, feeling tired, lack of concentration and 
      | moodiness. Long term effects, Parkinson, ADHD, Dementia, Cancer and much more.

    p.
      Most cleaning companies claim they are using &quot;green products&quot; 
      which is another word for toxic 
      and deadly but not as much as before. The word &quot;green&quot; 
      is a marketing gimmick to sell more 
      toxic products to uninformed public. Cleaning companies from an ethical stand point should tell 
      us what kind of chemicals they are using and their potential side effects then let us decide 
      whether the risk is acceptable or not. Sadly the toxic side effects of these products usually 
      appears later in life due to the buildup in our systems resulting in deadly illnesses such as 
      Parkinson and cancer. I am speaking from personal experience; I lost my dad to Parkinson due to 
      his exposure to chemicals. Chemical companies by law are not obligated to list all their 
      ingredients on their labels; for a good reason if they do they will be out of business.

    p We at the 
      b All Natural Cleaning Company

      | borax, lemons and essential oils. The majority of our products are edible.
